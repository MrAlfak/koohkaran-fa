  Hero reveal for product detail pages.

  Timeline: the image sits shaded and a band of light rakes across it left →
  right. As the light leaves, the product name draws itself over the dark slab in
  outline; the white then rises in place behind the finished outline, everywhere
  except the name, which is a hole punched through it, so the stone underneath
  reads as the letterforms.

  The light pass runs on the GPU (see stoneLight.ts) so it can shade against
  relief taken from the photograph itself, rather than just re-exposing it. The
  wash stays in CSS, because it needs the product name knocked out of it and an
  SVG text mask does that better than a shader would.

  The <img> under the canvas is the fallback: with no WebGL there is no light
  pass, but the frame and the name reveal still read correctly.
